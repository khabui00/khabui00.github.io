summary: My group worked together to make a website that UH students can use to map the stray cats on campus.
---
My group and I made a website as a final project for our ICS 314 class. My group consisted of Nhan Bui, Maegan Chow, Germaine Juan and myself. Our final result was Meow Mapper, which is a website that UH Manoa students can use to track the stray cats on campus. The website lets user take pictures of cats and post where they last saw the cat as well as adopt the cats. We also made a volunteer signup page for anyone who wants to volunteer their time to help take care of the cats.
