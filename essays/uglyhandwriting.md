ESLint is like my mom when she was trying to teach me how to write when I was younger. She was very picky and strict on my handwriting and would erase my progress and make me start over when she didn't like how it looked. To this day, my handwriting is still pretty decent thanks to my mom. I believe ESLint is kind of like that minus the yelling and hitting.

I believe that the ESLint coding standard will help me learn JavaScript effectively. Unlike Eclipse, ESLint tells me my errors before I run the program. This helps me save time as ESLint points out my errors very precisely as I am typing out my code so I don't have to worry about receiving errors when I run the code and I can catch them all and fix them before I get a wall of text telling me what I did wrong. 

Overall, ESLint makes my code look very nice and organized which is very pleasing to my eyes and whoever is looking at my code. In the end, ESLint will help supplement my ability to organize my code and help me learn JavaScript as smoothly as possible.
