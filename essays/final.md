As the semester comes to a close and I look back on the ups and downs of the class, I see how far I have come as a programmer. Over  the past couple of months, I have learned multiple skills and techniques to improve my programming skills and understanding. I have also learned how to develop websites at a beginner level using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. 

## Configuration Management

I learned about configuration management through GitHub. Configuration management is like working on a project with a group through Google Slides or Google Docs. Through GitHub a group member can take the main code and edit the code as much as they want and post it as a branch so that it does not directly change the main code also known as the master branch. All the group members can do the same thing and when everyone has done their part of the code, the group can then decide whether or not to merge the branches into the master branch. This is to make sure that the new code that are developed by everyone does not break the master code and if it does, it is restricted to the branch that it is developed in and we can fix it through there.

My group members and I used GitHub to develop our website Meow Mapper. We were able to develop pages and make changes to the code without worrying about breaking anything. Even when something did break, it was contained within its separate branch and we were able to go in there and fix the problems. Eventually, we were able to complete our website to the best of our abilities using the knowledge we have learned throughout the semester.
